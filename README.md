# generator-simplesite

A generator for [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io).

### simplesite

Simple website generator. 
Provides a grunt task for compiling compass/sass on file save, and connecting to 
the chrome 'livereload' extension.

By default, the compass task generates sass debugging symbols for browser 
extensions like firesass.

This project can be used for scaffolding for test cases or substantial static 
sites.
