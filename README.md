### simplesite

This generator creates a very simple site project with very few
frills. Once generated, the site skeleton can be used to build out
larger projects if you wish. I might even use it for that myself.

But I built it specifically so I could quickly create test cases
within html/css/sass/js.


## License

None as of yet.
